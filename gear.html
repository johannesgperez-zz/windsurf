        <h3>Boards</h3>
        <p>Most modern windsurfers (1990s and later) are derived from the shortboard design, and are intended to be used ideally in planing mode, where the board is mostly skipping over the surface of the water, rather than cutting through and displacing
          the water. Planing is faster and gives more maneuverability, but requires a different technique from the displacement mode (which is also referred to as slogging or schlogging). Generally smaller boards and smaller sails are used as the wind
          increases.</p>
        <p>While windsurfing is possible under a wide range of wind conditions, most recreational windsurfers prefer to sail in conditions that allow for consistent planing with multi-purpose, not overly specialized, free-ride equipment. Larger (100 to 140
          liters) free-ride boards are capable of planing at wind speeds as low as 12 knots if rigged with an adequate, well-tuned sail in the six to eight square meter range. The pursuit of planing in lower winds has driven the popularity of wider and
          shorter boards, with which planing is possible in wind as low as 8 knots, if sails in the 10 to 12 square meter range are used.</p>
        <p>
          <h4>Modern windsurfing boards can be classified into many categories:</h4></p>
        <p><strong>Freeride</strong>: Boards meant for comfortable recreational cruising (mostly straight-line sailing and occasional turning) at planing speed (aka blasting), mainly in flat waters or in light to moderate swell. They typically fall into
          the volume range of 90 to 170 liters. </p>
        <p><strong>Formula Windsurfing Class</strong>: Shorter boards up to one meter in width, for use in Formula Windsurfing races.</p>
        <p><strong>Wave boards</strong>: Smaller, lighter, more maneuverable boards for use in breaking waves. </p>
        <p><strong>Freestyle boards</strong>: Related to wave boards in terms of maneuverability, these are wider, higher volume boards geared specifically at performing acrobatic tricks (jumps, rotations, slides, flips and loops) on flat water. </p>
        <p><strong>Slalom boards</strong>: Shortboards aimed at top speed, rather than maneuverability or ease of use.</p>
        <p><strong>Speed boards</strong>: In essence an extremely narrow and sleek slalom board, built for top speed only.</p>
        <p><strong>Beginner boards</strong>: (Sometimes called funboards) these often have a daggerboard, are almost as wide as Formula boards, and have plenty of volume, hence stability.</p>
        <p><strong>Racing longboards</strong>: Mistral One Design, or the Olympic RS:X class race boards.</p>
        <p><strong>Tandem Board</strong>: The most popular tandem board is the 'Starboard Gemeni II'.</p>

        <h3>Sails</h3>
        <p>Modern windsurfing sails are often made of monofilm (clear polyester film), dacron (woven polyester) and mylar. Areas under high load may be reinforced with kevlar.</p>
        <p>Two designs of a sail are predominant: camber induced and rotational. Cambered sails have 1â€“5 camber inducers - plastic devices at the ends of battens which cup against the mast. They help create a rigid aerofoil shape for faster speed and stability,
          but at the cost of maneuverability and how light the sail feels. The trend is that racier sails have camber inducers while wave sails and most recreational sails do not. The rigidity of the sail is also determined by a number of battens.</p>
        <p>Beginners' sails often do not have battens, so they are lighter and easier to use in light winds. However, as the sailor improves, a battened sail will provide greater stability in stronger winds.</p>
        <p>Rotational sails have battens which protrude beyond the back aspect of the mast. They flip or "rotate" to the other side of the mast when tacking or jibing, hence the rotation in the name. Rotational sails have an aerofoil shape on the leeward
          side when powered, but are nearly flat when sheeted out (unpowered). In comparison with cambered sails, rotational designs offer less power and stability when sailing straight, but are easier to handle when maneuvering. Rotational sails are
          usually lighter and easier to rig.</p>
        <p>A windsurfing sail is tensioned at two points: at the tack (by downhaul), and at the clew (by outhaul). There is a set of pulleys for downhauling at the tack, and a grommet at the clew. Most shape is given to the sail by applying a very strong
          downhaul, which by design bends the mast. The outhaul tension is relatively weak, mostly providing leverage for controlling the sail's angle of attack.</p>
